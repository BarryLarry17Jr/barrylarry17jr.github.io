Gerald the mechanic, Rufus the arms dealer, Odem the tatto artist and the leader of the gang;Big Tex! A distinguished child trafficker and expert molester. The gang thrived on being unique and brutal. With the exception being Odem. Although Odem looked like a fierce juvenile, he had a soft heart and never tried to harm anyone. In a situation where his fellow gang members where beating witnessâ€™ to death. Odem intervened and stopped the other members of acting so savagley. Odem learnt these principles from his master. This is significant as Odem is the only member of the gang to be mentored bythe Beef Master himself. After Odem completed his training with the Beef Master. The Beef Master went into hiding as he believed that Odem would continue his legacy. One day the Beef Master will emerge and bring order to Lawrence.</p>
