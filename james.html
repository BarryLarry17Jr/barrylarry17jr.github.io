<div id="gravybody">
		<p>Gravy (James Greaves ) was nearly aborted at birth but his parents were too poor to afford an abortion. As a consequence Gravy was born. He had no skills and was literally dead weight. His life is so bland that there was nothing more to write on his life. Gravy really is a normie.</p>
