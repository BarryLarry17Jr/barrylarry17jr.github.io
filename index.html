<p> Now that you have had a gander at the beef wellingtons, you will now go on a short adventure to find Barry!<p/> <br />
<p>The instructions are as follows:<p>
<ol>
	<li>Click the beef wellington below.</li>
	<li>Once directed to an array of beef wellingtons, chose one of them wisely.</li>
	<li>If you chose incorrectly you will be directed to the beginning. Alternatively if you choose correctly, you will be administered to even more beef
wellingtons!</li>
	<li>Barry will enlighten you once all the correct beef wellingtons have been chosen. And don't forget if you choose the wrong beef wellington you will have to restart.</li>
